•	Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
The Gaming Room is a client that has a game called Draw It or Lose It that is only available in an Android app.  They want to develop a web-based version of the app that works on multiple platforms.  In this game, the application will show images as clues to the teams where they will guess a puzzle.  There are four rounds that last one minute each.  The drawings are loaded at a steady rate and are complete at the 30 second mark.  If the time expires before the team guesses the puzzle, the other teams will have a 15 second chance to solve the puzzle.  Software requirements include: a game must be able to have one or more teams involved; each team will have multiple players assigned to it; game and team names must be unique; only one instance of a game can exist in memory at any given time.

•	What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
I think I did well on the recommendation portion of this document.  I was very thorough in my answers and reasoning.

•	What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
Working through a design document can be very helpful when developing code, because you have laid out software requirements, design constraints, and a domain model with a UML diagram.  Having these helped tremendously when building code so you can see exactly what needs to be done without having to go multiple places to find the answers you are looking for.

•	If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
If I could choose one part of this document to revise, it would be the evaluations of development requirements.  There are some improvements I could make to make it more understandable and to get my point across better.  I did make some recommended changes to the document, but there is always room for improvement.

•	How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
Interpreting the user’s needs and implementing them into the software design is important.  I did this by taking into consideration the software and design requirements, along with what the game already consists of in the app.  Another way to interpret the user’s needs is to put yourself in their shoes and think about besides what is required, what you would want to see in the game.  It is important to consider the user’s needs, because in the long run they are your clients.  If you create a positive experience for the user, they will talk to other people about your product and will most likely follow other things you create.  This will create more business for the designer and will help determine whether your project was a success or not.

•	How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
I approached designing this software through object-oriented design and the use of the software design template.  I believe the techniques I used worked well together.  As long as the project I am working on uses an object-oriented language, I will use an object-oriented design approach because it is easier to separate and group codes together, so they are easily changed and added on to.
